# âœ… Backend Error Fixed!

## What Was Wrong
The app was showing: **"JSON Parse error: Unexpected character: <"**

This happened because the backend server wasn't running, so the app was getting HTML error pages instead of JSON data.

## âœ… What's Fixed

1. **Better Error Detection** - The app now detects when backend is unavailable
2. **Automatic Demo Mode** - Falls back to demo mode when backend isn't running
3. **Clear Error Messages** - Shows exactly what's wrong and how to fix it

## ðŸŽ¯ How to Use the App Now

### Option 1: Demo Mode (No Backend Needed) âœ¨
Just start the app and login with:
- **Email**: `test@example.com`
- **Password**: `Test123!`

```bash
bun start
```

The app will automatically detect the backend is unavailable and use demo mode.

### Option 2: With Backend (Full Features) ðŸš€

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
bun backend/server.ts
```

**Terminal 2 - Start Frontend:**
```bash
bun start
```

Then login with any registered account or create a new one.

## ðŸ“± What You'll See

### If Backend is Not Running:
```
Backend is not available. For demo mode, use: test@example.com / Test123!
```

### If Backend is Running:
- Login with any registered account
- Or create a new account
- Full backend features available
