# ✅ Errors Fixed - Final Summary

## Issues Resolved

### 1. Webpack Module Resolution Error ❌ → ✅
**Error**: `Can't resolve '../../../../../app'`

**Root Cause**: expo-router's `_ctx.web.js` was trying to resolve the app directory using relative paths that weren't properly aliased in webpack configuration.

**Solution Applied**:
- Updated `webpack.config.js` to add comprehensive path aliases
- Changed `EXPO_ROUTER_APP_ROOT` from `'app'` to `'./app'`
- Added `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` to handle all relative path variations
- Added directory existence check to fail fast if app directory is missing

**Files Modified**:
- `webpack.config.js`

---

### 2. expo-notifications SDK 53 Warning ⚠️ → ✅
**Error**: `Android Push notifications removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53`

**Root Cause**: expo-notifications module was being imported at module initialization, causing the error to be thrown immediately on Android Expo Go.

**Solution Applied**:
- Changed to conditional `require()` for expo-notifications
- Only loads the module when NOT in Expo Go on Android
- Gracefully handles unsupported environments
- All notification methods check `isNotificationsSupported` flag before executing

**Files Modified**:
- `utils/push-notifications.ts`

---

### 3. React Invalid Component Type Error ❌ → ✅
**Error**: `Element type is invalid: expected a string or a class/function but got: undefined`

**Root Cause**: `VibePostCard` component had both named and default exports, causing confusion in the module system.

**Solution Applied**:
- Removed named export `export { VibePostCard }`
- Kept only default export `export default VibePostCard`
- This matches the import style used in `app/(tabs)/index.tsx`

**Files Modified**:
- `components/vibepost/VibePostCard.tsx`
