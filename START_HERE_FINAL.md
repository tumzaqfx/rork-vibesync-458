# ðŸš€ VibeSync - Quick Start Guide

## The Problem
- `better-sqlite3` was compiled for Node.js, not Bun
- Frontend had Expo Router configuration issues

## The Solution

### Run these 2 commands:

```bash
# 1. Fix the issues
chmod +x QUICK_FIX_NOW.sh && ./QUICK_FIX_NOW.sh

# 2. Start the app
chmod +x START_VIBESYNC_FIXED.sh && ./START_VIBESYNC_FIXED.sh
```

That's it! ðŸŽ‰

## What Gets Fixed

1. **better-sqlite3 rebuild** - Recompiles for Bun compatibility
2. **Cache cleanup** - Removes old build artifacts
3. **Backend startup** - SQLite database with proper initialization
4. **Frontend startup** - Expo with correct routing

## After Starting

- Backend: http://localhost:3000
- Frontend: Opens automatically in Expo
- Press 'w' for web browser
- Scan QR code for mobile

## Demo Login
```
Email: test@example.com
Password: Test123!
```

## If You Still Have Issues

Check the logs:
```bash
# Backend logs
cat backend.log

# Test backend health
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

**Note:** The first startup might take 30-60 seconds while dependencies are rebuilt.
