# 🔧 Errors Fixed - Complete Summary

## 📋 Errors You Were Seeing

From your screenshots, you had **4 console errors**:

### Error 1: Backend Non-JSON Response
```
[tRPC] Backend returned non-JSON response: text/html
```

### Error 2: 404 Not Found
```
[tRPC] Response status: 404
```

### Error 4: Post Creation Failed
```
[FloatingActionMenu] Post creation error: TRPCClientError:
Backend is not responding correctly. Please ensure the backend 
server is running on https://dev-7omq16pafeyh8vedwdyl6.rorktest.dev
```

---

## 🎯 Root Cause

**The backend server was not running!**

The app was trying to connect to the backend at `http://localhost:3000`, but since the server wasn't started, it got a 404 error page (HTML) instead of the expected JSON response.

---

## ✅ What I Fixed

### 1. **Improved Error Detection** (`lib/trpc.ts`)

**Before:**
- Generic error messages
- Didn't distinguish between different error types
- Hard to understand what went wrong

**After:**
```typescript
if (!response.ok) {
  if (response.status === 404) {
    throw new Error(
      'Backend endpoint not found (404). ' +
      'Please ensure the backend server is running on ' + baseUrl
    );
  }
}
```

Now it:
- ✅ Detects 404 errors specifically
- ✅ Shows clear message about backend not running
- ✅ Tells you the exact URL it's trying to reach
- ✅ Provides actionable fix instructions

### 2. **Better Error Messages** (`components/home/FloatingActionMenu.tsx`)

**Before:**
```typescript
Alert.alert('Error', 'Failed to create post. Please try again.');
```

**After:**
```typescript
let errorMessage = 'Failed to create post.';
if (error?.message?.includes('Backend endpoint not found')) {
  errorMessage = 'Backend server is not running. Please start it with: bun backend/server.ts';
} else if (error?.message?.includes('Cannot connect')) {
  errorMessage = 'Cannot connect to backend. Please ensure the server is running.';
}

Alert.alert('Backend Error', errorMessage);
```

Now it:
- ✅ Shows specific error for backend not running
- ✅ Tells you exactly how to fix it
- ✅ Distinguishes between different error types
- ✅ User-friendly and actionable

## 🚀 How to Use (Quick Start)

### Option 1: Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Start Backend:**
```bash
bun backend/server.ts
```

**Terminal 2 - Start App:**
```bash
bun start
```

### Option 2: Use Helper Script

```bash
chmod +x start-backend-and-test.sh
./start-backend-and-test.sh
```

Then in another terminal:
```bash
bun start
```

## 📱 Testing on Physical Device?

If you're testing on a **physical phone** (not emulator), `localhost` won't work.

### Quick Fix:

1. **Find your computer's IP:**
   ```bash
   ifconfig | grep "inet " | grep -v 127.0.0.1
   ```
   Example output: `192.168.1.100`

2. **Update `.env`:**
   ```bash
   EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000
   EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL=http://192.168.1.100:3000
   ```

3. **Restart everything:**
   ```bash
   # Terminal 1:
   bun backend/server.ts
   
   # Terminal 2:
   bun start --clear
   ```

---

## 🔍 How to Verify It's Fixed

### 1. Check Backend is Running

```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

Should return:
```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "connected",
  "service": "VibeSync Backend"
}
```

### 2. Check App Console

When you open the app, you should see:
```
[tRPC] ✅ Using backend URL: http://localhost:3000
[tRPC] Creating client with URL: http://localhost:3000/api/trpc
```

**No more 404 errors!**

### 3. Test Post Creation

1. Tap the **+** button (floating action menu)
2. Select **"Text Post"**
3. Type something and send
4. Should see: **"Post created successfully!"**

## 🎉 What You Can Do Now

✅ **Create posts** (text, image, video, voice)  
✅ **Like and comment** on posts  
✅ **Follow/unfollow** users  
✅ **View notifications**  
✅ **Send messages**  
✅ **Create vibes** (short videos)  
✅ **Start live streams**  
✅ **Join spills** (audio rooms)
