# Authentication Fix Summary

## What Was Fixed

### 1. **Backend URL Priority**
- Updated `lib/trpc.ts` to prioritize `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` over tunnel URL
- This ensures the app connects to your local backend first
- Added logging to show which backend URL is being used

### 2. **Improved Login Flow**
- Changed authentication to attempt backend login FIRST
- Only falls back to demo mode if there's a network error
- Better error messages to distinguish between:
  - Invalid credentials (user doesn't exist)
  - Backend not available (network error)
  - Demo mode requirements

### 3. **Better Error Messages**
- Clear indication when backend is not available
- Helpful guidance to use demo mode when backend is down
- Specific message for invalid credentials with signup suggestion

## Current Situation

### Your Login Attempt
You tried to log in with: `jason.zama@gmail.com`

**Result:** Login failed with "Invalid email or password"

**Reason:** This email address does not exist in the database yet.

## How to Fix

### Option 1: Create Your Account (Recommended)

1. **Start the backend** (if not already running):
   ```bash
   bun backend/server.ts
   ```

2. **Use the registration screen**:
   - Open the app
   - Click "Sign Up" on the login screen
   - Fill in your details:
     - Email: jason.zama@gmail.com
     - Username: jasonzama (or any username you prefer)
     - Display Name: Jason Zama
     - Password: Your secure password
   - Submit the form
   - You'll be automatically logged in

### Option 2: Create User via Script

1. **Start the backend**:
   ```bash
   bun backend/server.ts
   ```

2. **Run the user creation script**:
   ```bash
   bun scripts/create-test-user.ts jason.zama@gmail.com YourPassword123! jasonzama "Jason Zama"
   ```

3. **Log in with your new credentials**

### Option 3: Use Demo Mode

If you just want to test the app without creating an account:

1. Use the demo credentials:
   - Email: `test@example.com`
   - Password: `Test123!`

2. This works even if the backend is not running

## Verifying the Fix

### 1. Check Backend is Running

```bash
# Should return: {"status":"ok",...}
curl http://localhost:3000/health
```

### 2. Check Environment Variables

Your `.env` file should have:
```env
EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
DATABASE_URL=postgresql://localhost:5432/vibesync
```

### 3. Test Login Flow

1. Open the app
2. Try logging in with your credentials
3. Check the console logs:
   - Should see: `[tRPC] Using local backend URL: http://localhost:3000`
   - Should see: `[Auth] Attempting backend login for: your-email@example.com`
   - If successful: `[Auth] Backend login successful, session stored`
   - If failed: Clear error message explaining the issue

## What Happens Now

### When Backend is Running:
1. App attempts to authenticate with the backend
2. If credentials are valid → Login successful
3. If credentials are invalid → Error: "Invalid credentials"
4. User data is stored in PostgreSQL database
5. JWT tokens are issued for session management

### When Backend is NOT Running:
1. App attempts to authenticate with the backend
2. Network error occurs
3. App falls back to demo mode
4. Only demo credentials work: `test@example.com` / `Test123!`
5. Error message guides user to use demo credentials

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Backend starts successfully on port 3000
- [ ] Health check endpoint responds: `http://localhost:3000/health`
- [ ] Database connection is working
- [ ] Can create new user via registration screen
- [ ] Can log in with created user credentials
- [ ] Demo mode works when backend is down
- [ ] Error messages are clear and helpful

## Common Errors and Solutions

### "Backend is not available. For demo mode, use: test@example.com / Test123!"
**Solution:** Start the backend with `bun backend/server.ts`

### "Invalid credentials"
**Solution:** Create an account using the registration screen or the create-test-user script

### "Network request failed"
**Solution:** 
1. Check backend is running
2. Verify `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL` in `.env`
3. Check firewall settings

### "Cannot connect to database"
**Solution:**
1. Ensure PostgreSQL is running
2. Verify `DATABASE_URL` in `.env`
3. Run database schema: `psql -d vibesync -f backend/db/schema.sql`
