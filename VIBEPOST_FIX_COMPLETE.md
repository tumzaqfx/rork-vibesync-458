# VibePost Component Fix - Complete

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Import Issues in VibePostCard
**Problem:** The component was importing Avatar and VerifiedBadge as default imports, but they were only exported as named exports.

**Solution:** 
- Changed imports in `VibePostCard.tsx` to use named imports:
  ```typescript
  import { Avatar } from '@/components/ui/Avatar';
  import { VerifiedBadge } from '@/components/ui/VerifiedBadge';
  ```

### 2. Missing Default Exports
**Problem:** Avatar and VerifiedBadge components didn't have default exports, which could cause issues in some import scenarios.

**Solution:**
- Added default exports to both components:
  - `components/ui/Avatar.tsx` - Added `export default Avatar;`
  - `components/ui/VerifiedBadge.tsx` - Added `export default VerifiedBadge;`

## Files Modified

1. **components/vibepost/VibePostCard.tsx**
   - Changed Avatar import from default to named import
   - Changed VerifiedBadge import from default to named import

2. **components/ui/Avatar.tsx**
   - Added default export

3. **components/ui/VerifiedBadge.tsx**
   - Added default export

## Error Resolution

The following errors should now be resolved:
- ✅ "React.jsx: type is invalid -- expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined"
- ✅ "Element type is invalid: expected a string (for built-in components) or a class/function (for composite components) but got: undefined"
- ✅ "Check the render method of `VibePostCard`"

## Note on expo-notifications Warning

The warning about `expo-notifications` is expected in Expo Go SDK 53:
```
ERROR expo-notifications: Android Push notifications (remote notifications) functionality 
provided by expo-notifications was removed from Expo Go with the release of SDK 53.
```

This is a known limitation of Expo Go and doesn't affect the app functionality. To use push notifications, you would need to create a development build instead of using Expo Go.

## Testing

After these changes, the VibePost cards should render correctly in the home feed without any component type errors.
