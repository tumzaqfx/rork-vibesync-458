# Quick Login Fix - TL;DR

## The Problem
You tried to log in with `jason.zama@gmail.com` but got an error because this account doesn't exist in the database yet.

## The Solution (Choose One)

### ðŸš€ Quick Fix #1: Use Demo Mode
```
Email:    test@example.com
Password: Test123!
```
Works immediately, no setup needed!

### ðŸŽ¯ Quick Fix #2: Create Your Account
1. Start backend: `bun backend/server.ts`
2. In the app, click "Sign Up"
3. Fill in your details and submit
4. You're logged in!

### âš¡ Quick Fix #3: Create User via Command
```bash
# Start backend first
bun backend/server.ts

# In another terminal, create your user
bun scripts/create-test-user.ts jason.zama@gmail.com YourPassword123! jasonzama "Jason Zama"

# Now log in with your credentials
```

## What Changed
- âœ… App now tries backend authentication first
- âœ… Falls back to demo mode only if backend is down
- âœ… Better error messages
- âœ… Backend URL priority fixed

## Verify It's Working
```bash
# Check backend is running
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Should return: {"status":"ok",...}
```

## That's It!
Choose one of the three options above and you're good to go! ðŸŽ‰
