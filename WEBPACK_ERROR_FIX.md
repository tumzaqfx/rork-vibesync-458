# Webpack Error Fix

## Issues Fixed

### 1. Module Resolution Error
**Error**: `Can't resolve '../../../../../app'`

**Solution**: Updated webpack.config.js to add proper path aliases for the app directory.

### 2. expo-notifications Warning
**Error**: Android Push notifications removed from Expo Go SDK 53

**Solution**: Modified utils/push-notifications.ts to conditionally load expo-notifications only when supported.

## Changes Made

### webpack.config.js
- Added fs module to check if app directory exists
- Changed `EXPO_ROUTER_APP_ROOT` from `'app'` to `'./app'`
- Added multiple path aliases for app directory resolution
- Added `NormalModuleReplacementPlugin` to handle relative path resolution
- Added `__DEV__` definition

### utils/push-notifications.ts
- Changed to conditionally require expo-notifications
- Only loads notifications module when not in Expo Go on Android
- Prevents the error from being thrown during module initialization

## How to Test

1. Clear the build cache:
```bash
rm -rf .expo node_modules/.cache
```

2. Start the web server:
```bash
bun run start-web
```

3. Verify:
- No webpack errors about app directory
- No expo-notifications errors in console
- App loads successfully

## Notes

- The expo-notifications warning is expected in Expo Go on Android (SDK 53 limitation)
- For production, use a development build instead of Expo Go
- Web platform doesn't support push notifications natively
