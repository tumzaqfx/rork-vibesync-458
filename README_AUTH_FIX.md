App attempts backend login
    ↓
Valid credentials? → ✅ Login successful
Invalid credentials? → ❌ "Invalid email or password"
```

### When Backend is NOT Running:
```
User enters credentials
    ↓
App attempts backend login
    ↓
Network error detected
    ↓
Fall back to demo mode
    ↓
Demo credentials? → ✅ Demo login successful
Other credentials? → ❌ "Backend not available, use demo"
```
