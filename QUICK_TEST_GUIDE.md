# Quick Test Guide: Get an APK for Your Phone

This guide will get you a test APK file that you can install and run on your Android phone.

Even for testing, your app needs a live backend server to connect to. You cannot test features like login or posting without it.

## Step 1: Deploy Your Backend (The Most Important Step)

I have already created a step-by-step guide for this. It's the easiest and fastest way to get your backend online for testing.

1.  **Follow the instructions in `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md`**. This will help you deploy your backend to Vercel for free.
2.  When you are finished, you will have a **public URL** for your backend (it will look something like `https://your-project-name.vercel.app`).
3.  **This is the only manual part.** You have to do this step, as it requires signing up for a Vercel account and connecting it to your Git repository.

**Once you have your backend URL, tell me what it is.**

## Step 2: I Will Configure the App for the Build

Once you give me the public URL from Step 1, I will automatically:

1.  Update the app's code to make it connect to your new live backend.
2.  Configure the project for building an APK.

## Step 3: We Will Build the APK

After I've configured the app, I will provide you with the final commands to:

1.  Log in to your Expo account from the terminal.
2.  Start the APK build process using Expo Application Services (EAS).
3.  Download the finished APK file.

**To get started, please open `DEPLOYMENT_GUIDE.md` and complete Step 1. Let me know as soon as you have the public backend URL.**
