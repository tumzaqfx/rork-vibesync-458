# 🎯 START HERE - Fixed All Issues!

## What Was Wrong:
1. ❌ **Port 3000 already in use** - Backend was running in background
2. ❌ **`bun rork` command doesn't exist** - Should be `npx expo`

## ✅ All Fixed! Run This:

```bash
bash start-app.sh
```

That's it! This will:
1. Kill any existing backend on port 3000
2. Start the backend server
3. Wait for it to be healthy
4. Start Expo with tunnel for mobile testing

## 📱 What You'll See:

## 🔧 Alternative: Manual Start

**Terminal 1 - Backend:**
```bash
bash kill-backend.sh
bun run backend/server.ts
```

**Terminal 2 - Frontend:**
```bash
npx expo start --tunnel
```

## 🐛 If You Still See Errors:

### "Port 3000 in use":
```bash
bash kill-backend.sh
```

### "Network request failed" during registration:
- Check backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
- Check `.env` file has correct `EXPO_PUBLIC_RORK_API_BASE_URL`
- Check database connection in `.env`

### "JSON Parse error":
- Backend is returning HTML instead of JSON
- Usually means backend crashed or wrong URL
- Check `backend.log` file for errors

## 📋 Quick Checklist:

- [ ] Run `bash start-app.sh`
- [ ] Wait for "Backend is healthy" message
- [ ] Wait for QR code to appear
- [ ] Scan QR code with Expo Go app
- [ ] Try registering with your email

## 🎉 You're Ready!

The startup issues are fixed. If registration still fails, it's likely:
- Database connection issue
- Missing environment variables
- Backend API endpoint issue

But the app will START properly now!
