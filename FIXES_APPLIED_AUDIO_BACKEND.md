# ðŸ”§ Audio & Backend Fixes Applied

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Audio Loading Errors
**Problem:** Voice posts and statuses were using broken audio URLs from `www2.cs.uic.edu`
**Solution:** Replaced all broken audio URLs with working SoundHelix MP3 files

**Files Updated:**
- `mocks/voice-posts.ts` - All 10 voice posts now use working audio URLs
- `mocks/statuses.ts` - All voice statuses now use working audio URLs

**New Audio URLs:**
```
https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-1.mp3
https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-2.mp3
https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-3.mp3
https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-4.mp3
https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-5.mp3
https://www.soundhelix.com/examples/mp3/SoundHelix-Song-6.mp3
```

### 2. âœ… Backend Health Check Improvements
**Problem:** Backend health checks were failing, especially on Android emulator
**Solution:** Improved backend URL detection and Android emulator support

**Changes in `utils/backend-health.ts`:**
- Simplified backend URL detection
- Added automatic localhost â†’ 10.0.2.2 conversion for Android emulator
- Removed complex tunnel URL logic that was causing issues
- Better error messages and logging

**How it works:**
- **Web:** Uses `http://localhost:3000` directly
- **Android Emulator:** Automatically converts `localhost` to `10.0.2.2`
- **Physical Devices:** Use the configured backend URL

### 3. âœ… Backend Startup Scripts
**Created:** `START_BACKEND_NOW.sh` - Simple script to start backend
**Created:** `TEST_BACKEND_NOW.sh` - Script to test backend endpoints

## How to Start the Backend

### Option 1: Using the new script (Recommended)
```bash
chmod +x START_BACKEND_NOW.sh
./START_BACKEND_NOW.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual start
```bash
# Kill any existing process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Start the backend
bun run backend/server.ts
```

## How to Test the Backend

```bash
chmod +x TEST_BACKEND_NOW.sh
./TEST_BACKEND_NOW.sh
```

This will test:
1. Health endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/health`
2. API health endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/health`
3. tRPC endpoint: `http://localhost:3000/api/trpc/example.hi`

## Expected Results

### âœ… Audio Should Now Work
- Voice posts should play without errors
- Voice statuses should play without errors
- No more "Unable to resolve host" errors

### âœ… Backend Health Checks Should Pass
- Web: Direct connection to localhost:3000
- Android Emulator: Automatic connection to 10.0.2.2:3000
- Better error messages if backend is not running

## Verification Steps

1. **Start the backend:**
   ```bash
   ./START_BACKEND_NOW.sh
   ```

2. **Test the backend:**
   ```bash
   ./TEST_BACKEND_NOW.sh
   ```
   You should see:
   ```json
   {"status":"ok","timestamp":"..."}
   ```

3. **Start the app:**
   ```bash
   bun start
   ```

4. **Test voice features:**
   - Go to Home tab â†’ Try playing voice posts
   - Go to Status â†’ Try playing voice statuses
   - No errors should appear

## Performance Improvements

### VirtualizedList Warning
The warning about slow VirtualizedList updates is expected with large lists. To improve:
- Components already use React.memo() where appropriate
- Consider implementing windowing for very long lists
- The warning appears when list has 6000+ pixels of content

## Troubleshooting

### If audio still doesn't play:
1. Check internet connection
2. Try a different audio URL
3. Check expo-av permissions

### If backend health checks fail:
1. Make sure backend is running: `./START_BACKEND_NOW.sh`
2. Test manually: `curl http://localhost:3000/health`
3. Check if port 3000 is available: `lsof -i:3000`

### If Android emulator can't connect:
1. Backend should auto-convert localhost to 10.0.2.2
2. Check logs for "[BackendHealth] Native: Converting localhost..."
3. Verify backend is running on host machine

## What Was Working Before

Early in development, the backend was running smoothly because:
1. Simple localhost configuration
2. No complex tunnel URL logic
3. Direct health check endpoints

We've restored this simplicity while adding Android emulator support.

## Next Steps

1. âœ… Audio URLs fixed
2. âœ… Backend health checks improved
3. âœ… Startup scripts created
4. ðŸ”„ Test on physical device (may need tunnel URL)
5. ðŸ”„ Add more diverse audio content
