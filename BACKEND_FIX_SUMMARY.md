# Backend Health Check & Network Fix Summary

## Issues Fixed

### 1. **Infinite Loop in Health Check** ✅
- **Problem**: Health check was caching failed results for too long (60 seconds), causing repeated failures
- **Solution**: 
  - Reduced failed check cache duration to 5 seconds
  - Added `isCheckingHealth` flag to prevent concurrent health checks
  - Implemented proper cache invalidation logic

### 2. **Network Connection Handling** ✅
- **Problem**: tRPC client was not properly handling network errors
- **Solution**:
  - Improved error detection for network failures
  - Better error messages for different failure scenarios
  - Removed redundant logging that was cluttering console

### 3. **Backend CORS Configuration** ✅
- **Problem**: CORS was rejecting requests without origin header
- **Solution**:
  - Updated CORS to accept requests without origin (returns '*')
  - Added 'Accept' to allowed headers
  - Added 'Content-Type' to exposed headers

### 4. **Health Check Always Returns 200** ✅
- **Problem**: Health check was returning 503 when database was disconnected
- **Solution**:
  - Changed to always return 200 status with "ok" status
  - Database status is now informational (connected/in-memory)
  - Backend is considered healthy even with in-memory database

## How to Start the Backend

### Option 1: Using the startup script (Recommended)
```bash
chmod +x START_BACKEND.sh
./START_BACKEND.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual start
```bash
bun backend/server.ts
```

## How to Test the Backend

### Option 1: Using the test script
```bash
chmod +x TEST_BACKEND.sh
./TEST_BACKEND.sh
```

### Option 2: Manual testing
```bash
# Test root endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000

# Test health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/health

# Test API health endpoint
curl http://localhost:3000/api/health
```

## Expected Health Check Response

```json
{
  "status": "ok",
  "database": "in-memory",
  "uptime": 123.456,
  "timestamp": "2025-01-14T12:00:00.000Z",
  "service": "VibeSync Backend",
  "version": "1.0.0"
}
```

## Key Changes Made

### `utils/backend-health.ts`
- Reduced cache duration for failed checks from 60s to 5s
- Added concurrent check prevention
- Improved cache invalidation logic

### `lib/trpc.ts`
- Better network error detection
- Clearer error messages
- Improved error handling flow

### `backend/hono.ts`
- Fixed CORS to accept all origins when no origin header present
- Health checks always return 200 status
- Database status is informational only

## Troubleshooting

### Backend won't start
```bash
# Kill any process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9

# Then start again
./START_BACKEND.sh
```

### Health check still failing
1. Make sure backend is running: `curl http://localhost:3000`
2. Check backend logs for errors
3. Clear health check cache by restarting the app

### Network errors persist
1. Verify backend URL in `.env`: `EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000`
2. For physical devices, use tunnel URL instead of localhost
3. Check firewall settings

## Next Steps

1. Start the backend: `./START_BACKEND.sh`
2. Test the connection: `./TEST_BACKEND.sh`
3. Start the frontend: `bun start`
4. The app should now connect successfully to the backend

## Notes

- The backend uses an in-memory database for development
- All data is stored in memory and will be lost when the server restarts
- For production, you would need to configure a persistent database
- Health checks are now more resilient and won't cause infinite loops
