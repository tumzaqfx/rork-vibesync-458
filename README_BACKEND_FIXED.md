## 🚀 How to Start

### Option 1: Everything at Once (Recommended)
```bash
./start-all.sh
```
Starts backend locally + frontend. Perfect for development.

### Option 2: Backend with Tunnel (For Mobile)
```bash
./start-all-tunnel.sh
```
Starts backend with tunnel + frontend. Use this for mobile testing.

### Option 3: Manual Control (Two Terminals)
```bash
# Terminal 1: Backend
./start-backend.sh

# Terminal 2: Frontend
bun start
```
Gives you separate logs for easier debugging.

---

## 🧪 Test Your Backend

```bash
# Run the test script
./test-backend.sh
```

This will check:
- ✅ If local backend is running
- ✅ If tunnel backend is running
- ✅ Health check endpoints
- ✅ Response format

---

## 📋 All Available Commands

### Start Backend
```bash
./start-backend.sh              # Local backend
./start-backend-tunnel.sh       # Backend with tunnel
bun run backend/server.ts       # Direct command (local)
bunx rork backend -p 7omq16pafeyh8vedwdyl6  # Direct command (tunnel)
```

### Start Frontend
```bash
bun start                       # Standard start
bun rork start -p 7omq16pafeyh8vedwdyl6 --tunnel  # With tunnel
```

### Start Both
```bash
./start-all.sh                  # Local backend + frontend
./start-all-tunnel.sh           # Tunnel backend + frontend
```

### Test
```bash
./test-backend.sh               # Test backend health
curl http://localhost:3000/health           # Manual test (local)
curl https://dev-7omq16pafeyh8vedwdyl6.rorktest.dev/health  # Manual test (tunnel)
```

## 🔍 What Changed

### Before (Broken) ❌
```bash
bun run backend &
# Error: Script not found "backend"

bun run backend &
# bash: Backend: command not found
# bash: Connected: command not found
```

### After (Fixed) ✅
```bash
./start-backend.sh
# 🚀 Starting VibeSync Backend Server...
# ✅ Backend server running on http://localhost:3000

./start-all.sh
# 📦 Step 1: Starting Backend Server...
# ✅ Backend is running!
# 📱 Step 2: Starting Frontend...
```

---

## 🎯 Recommended Workflow

### Daily Development
```bash
./start-all.sh
```
- Fast startup
- Local backend
- Perfect for quick iterations
- No tunnel overhead

### Mobile Testing
```bash
./start-all-tunnel.sh
```
- Backend accessible from mobile
- Scan QR code with Expo Go
- Test on real devices

### Debugging
```bash
# Terminal 1
./start-backend.sh

# Terminal 2
bun start
```
- Separate logs
- Easy to restart individual services
- Better error visibility

## 🚨 Troubleshooting

### Backend Won't Start

**Problem:** Port already in use
```bash
# Solution: Kill process on port 3000
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
# or
pkill -f "backend/server.ts"

# Then restart
./start-backend.sh
```

**Problem:** Database connection error
```bash
# Solution: Start PostgreSQL
brew services start postgresql  # macOS
sudo systemctl start postgresql # Linux

# Create database
createdb vibesync

# Check .env file
cat .env
```

### Health Check Fails

**Problem:** Backend not responding
```bash
# Check if backend is running
ps aux | grep "backend/server.ts"

# Check logs for errors
# (Look at terminal where backend is running)

# Restart backend
pkill -f "backend/server.ts"
./start-backend.sh
```

### Frontend Can't Connect

**Problem:** Wrong backend URL
```bash
# Check .env file
cat .env

# Should have:
# EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=http://localhost:3000
# or
# EXPO_PUBLIC_BACKEND_URL=https://dev-7omq16pafeyh8vedwdyl6.rorktest.dev

# Clear Expo cache
npx expo start --clear
```

## 💡 Pro Tips

1. **Always use shell scripts** - They handle everything for you
2. **Test with `./test-backend.sh`** - Quick health check
3. **Keep backend running** - No need to restart for frontend changes
4. **Use local backend for speed** - Tunnel only when needed
5. **Check logs first** - They usually tell you what's wrong

---

## 🎓 Understanding the Fix

### Why It Failed Before
- `package.json` had no "backend" script
- Running `bun run backend &` tried to find a script that didn't exist
- The error output was interpreted as bash commands
- This caused "command not found" errors

### How It's Fixed Now
- Created `backend/server.ts` - proper server file
- Created shell scripts - easy to use, no package.json needed
- Scripts handle environment setup automatically
- Clear error messages and logging
- Graceful shutdown handling
